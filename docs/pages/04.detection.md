title: Detection
summary: "It explains how to detect somatic mutations in cancer samples, 
which variant callers are available, and how to customize the detection process."

Starting from BAM files, 
Musta efficiently performs variant calling in either tumor-normal matched mode or tumor-only mode, 
depending on the provided input files for each sample. 

To achieve the highest accuracy, Musta employs a combination of six powerful variant callers: 
* [Mutect2](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593851-Mutect2)
* [Strelka2](https://github.com/Illumina/strelka)
* [Muse](https://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/public-software/muse/) 
* [Varscan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/)
* [VarDict](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDict) 
* [LoFreq](https://csb5.github.io/lofreq/).
