## Overview
Accurate detection and comprehensive analysis of somatic variants are a major task in cancer sample data analysis, 
which is routinely carried out combining different software packages with specific software dependencies 
and with the need of laborious and  time-consuming data format conversions. 

To overcome these limitations, we developed **Musta**, an *end-to-end pipeline to detect, classify 
and interpret mutations in cancer*. 

 **Musta** is a Python command-line tool that easily handles matched tumour-normal or tumour-only samples, from variant 
 calling to the deconvolution of mutational signatures, through variant annotation, 
 driver genes detection, pathway analysis, tumor heterogeneity. 
 
**Musta**'s core is *Snakemake-based* and  was conceived for an easy installation through the Docker platform. 
A simple Makefile bootstraps **Musta**, 
taking care of the installation, 
configuration and running steps and allowing the execution of the entire pipeline 
or any individual step depending on the starting data.

**Musta**  is currently used for cancer sample data analysis at the [CRS4-NGS Core](https://www.crs4.it/next/)
